# Krumpac Reforge Respawners

This mod will add custom spawners (using [Spawn That](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/ASharpPen/Spawn_That/)) that will make simple things respawn. This might improve especially the availability of materials on multiplayer servers.

## Features

* This mod will re-create some things that usually would only exist once in a certain area
  * bushes, like raspberry, blueberry, blackberry, ...
  * trees, like apple, orange, walnut, lemon
* This mod will spawn herbs in the wild (not only around altars)
  * Some altars are rather extremely hard to find
* This mod will spawn certain things that would just drop (drop chances very low)
  * Plum tree
  * Pumpkin
* This mod improves some of the Reforge fish spawners (more fish)
* This mod will remove the default Reforge spawners configs
